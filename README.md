# 🚢 Task-02: Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

This project is part of my Data Science Internship with **Prodigy Infotech**.  
The goal of this task is to perform **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the **Titanic Dataset** to discover meaningful insights and trends.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Handle missing data and clean the dataset
- Explore relationships between different features
- Identify key patterns affecting survival
- Visualize data effectively using plots and charts

---

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 📂 Dataset Source

- Titanic Dataset from Kaggle  
🔗 [https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps

### ✅ 1. Data Cleaning
- Dropped irrelevant columns like `Ticket`, `Cabin`
- Filled missing values in `Age`, `Embarked`
- Converted `Sex` and `Embarked` to categorical types

### 📊 2. Univariate Analysis
- Countplots for gender, class, and embarked
- Histograms for age and fare distribution

### 🔗 3. Bivariate Analysis
- Survival rate based on gender, class, age groups
- Correlation heatmap for numeric features

### 📈 4. Visualizations
- Bar plots
- Pie charts
- Box plots
- Heatmaps

## 📌 Key Insights

- 💡 **Female passengers had a much higher survival rate** than males
- 🎟 **Passengers in 1st class had better survival chances** than those in 3rd class
- 👶 **Children (age < 10)** had better chances of survival
- 💰 Higher fare paid → higher survival rate trend observed

## ✅ Status

> **Task Completed Successfully ✔️**

This task helped improve my understanding of data preprocessing, missing value handling, and EDA techniques in Python.
